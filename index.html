<p> John Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy and Marion Elaine Robison. His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and his mother was a homemaker. Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic. His paternal grandparent had immigrated to the United States from Poland.

Gacy was really close to his mother and two sisters, but did not get along with his father. Although their relationship was complicated, Gacy still loved his father, but felt he was “never good enough” in his father’s eyes.

Gacy was an overweight and unathletic child. Because of a heart condition, he was told to avoid all sports at school. During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience blackouts. He was hospitalized on occasion because of these episodes and also, in 1957, for a burst appendix. Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in hospital and attributed the decline of his grades to missing school. Gacy’s medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed. + to add jaycees shit </p>
