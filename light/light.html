His paternal grandparent had immigrated to the United States from Poland.<br /><br />Gacy was really close to his mother and two sisters, but did not get along with his father. Although their relationship was complicated, Gacy still loved his father, but felt he was “never good enough” in his father’s eyes. He was an overweight and unathletic child. Because of a heart condition, he was told to avoid all sports at school.<br /><br />Despite his poor childhood image, Gacy joined the Waterloo Jaycees, and found his place. He considered ambitious, and the other Jaycees held him in high regard for his fund-raising work, and in 1967 named him “outstanding vice-president” of the Waterloo Jaycees and served on the Board of Directors</div>
