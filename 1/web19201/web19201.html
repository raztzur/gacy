His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and <br />his mother was a homemaker. Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic. His paternal grandparent had immigrated to the United States from Poland.<br /><br />Gacy was really close to his mother and two sisters, but did not get along with his father. Although <br />their relationship was complicated, Gacy still loved his father, but felt he was “never good enough” <br />in his father’s eyes.<br /><br />Gacy was an overweight and unathletic child. Because of a heart condition, he was told to avoid all <br />sports at school. During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience blackouts. He was hospitalized on <br />occasion because of these episodes and also, in 1957, for a burst appendix. Gacy later estimated that <br />between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in hospital and attributed the decline of <br />his grades to missing school. Gacy’s medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed. </span><span class="johnWayneGacyWasBornInChicagoOnMarch171942TheSecondChildAndOnlySonOfJohnStanleyGacyAndMarionElaineRobisonHisFatherWasAnAutoRepairMachinistAndWorldWarIVeteranAndHisMotherWasAHomemakerGacyWasOfPolishAndD-1100">+ to add <br />jaycees shit</span></div>
